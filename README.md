# cake2 is a maintenance project for cakephp version 2!

This project forks from version 2.10.24 of cakephp and tries to upgrade it for PHP 7.4 and later.

The goal is to allow applications built on cakephp 2 to keep up with latest versions of PHP and latest versions of supporting packages, giving access to latest stability fixes and security patches.
